# Alive Email Validator

Alive Email Validator is a robust Python library designed for validating email addresses with correct syntax and deliverability. It ensures that the email addresses used in applications are valid and properly formatted, making it an essential tool for scenarios like registration/login forms.

## Features

- **Syntax Validation**: Validates that a string is of the form `name@example.com`.
- **Deliverability Check**: Optionally checks if the domain name is set up to receive email.
- **Existence Check**: Verifies if the email address actually exists.
- **Internationalized Domain Names**: Supports internationalized domain names.
- **Local Part Normalization**: Normalizes the local part of the email address.
- **Friendly Error Messages**: Provides clear and understandable error messages for failed validations.

## Setting Up the Git Project

To set up the Alive Email Validator project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alive-email-validator.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd alive-email-validator
```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip. It's recommended to use a virtual environment for this:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the Application**: You can now run the application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask application, and you can access it by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To validate an email address, you can use the `validate_email` function from the `email_validator` package.

```python
from email_validator import validate_email, EmailNotValidError

try:
    v = validate_email("test@example.com") # validate and get info
    print(v["email"]) # print the email
except EmailNotValidError as e:
    # email is not valid
    print(str(e))
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced usage, including checking deliverability and existence, refer to the documentation and examples provided in the `email_validator` package.
